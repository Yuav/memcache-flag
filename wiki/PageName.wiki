#summary memcache abstraction layer with flag support to disable a collection of keys
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Each key can have only one flag  Each flag and key holds a version number, flag has newer version than key - cache miss  Doesn't delete all keys related to flag, only invalidates  Only tries to initiate memcache connection once - cache miss returned at once on later requests 

= Features =

* Each key can have only one flag  
* Each flag and key holds a version number, flag has newer version than key - cache miss  * Doesn't delete all keys related to flag, only invalidates  
* Only tries to initiate memcache connection once - cache miss returned at once on later requests 


= Example usage =
<code>
require_once 'cache.class.php';
$cache = new cache(array('127.0.0.1'));
$value = rand(3,123);
echo 'set data: '.$value.' returned ';
if ($cache->set('test',$value,5,'test_flag')) echo "TRUE<br />";
echo 'before: '.$cache->get('test')."<br />";
echo "flag value: ".$cache->get('test_flag').' invalidated value: '.$cache->invalidate('test_flag')."<br />";
echo 'after: '.$cache->get('test')."<br />";

// For completeness
$cache->delete('test_flag');
